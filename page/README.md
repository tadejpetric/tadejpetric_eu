This folder serves as a linker of the project. One day will be the homepage of my personal website (where it will also serve only to link to other pages) but currently my Google Compute Engine demo credits ran out.

The views should only have connections to other subapps.

Description of the files and directories:
- `racuni` the folder with the implementation of the programming project
- `templates` holds `.html` files of any page in the app. This is so I have one central folder with every html template instead of them being scattered around. Search for the desired html files in the subdirectories
- `static` holds static files (`.js` and `.css`) of any page in the app. Works similarly as the templates directory
- `urls.py` mostly responsible for calling other URL files of subapps
- `views.py` responsible for calling the "linker" index site.
- `analiza` unused for now but will be used for my personal website.
